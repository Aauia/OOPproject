## ðŸŽ“ University System Simulation

**Branch:** genMain
**Tech Stack:** Java, OOP, Design Patterns, File I/O, Serialization  
**Team Role:** Team Lead & System Architect

### ðŸ§  Overview
This project simulates core components of a university system, including:
- Student registration and course enrollment
- Research paper and journal publishing for researchers
- Curriculum and project management
- Role-based behavior using decorators

### âœ¨ Features
- **User Roles:** Student, Researcher, Admin  
- **Design Patterns:**  
  - *Singleton* for global user session and data access  
  - *Decorator* to extend user behaviors dynamically  
- **Persistence:** Java Serialization & File I/O  
- **Menu-driven Interface:** CLI menus per user role  
- **Data Models:** `ResearchPaper`, `Journal`, `ResearchProject`, `Curriculum`, etc.

### ðŸ“‚ Branch Structure
The project code resides in the [`genMain`](https://github.com/Aauia/OOPproject.git) branch to separate it from main/test code.

### ðŸ“Œ Notes
- User sessions are maintained using a Singleton class.
- Research papers are linked with journals based on category.
- Serialization ensures data persists across restarts.
